<!-- 
(Airlines Reservation System) A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You have been asked to program the new system. You are to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airline's only plane (capacity: 10 seats).

Your program should display the following menu of alternatives: Please type 1 for "First Class" and Please type 2 for "Economy". If the person types 1, your program should assign a seat in the first-class section (seats 1-5). If the person types 2, your program should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6-10). Your program should print a boarding pass indicating the person's seat number and whether it is in the first-class section or economy section of the plane.

Use a one-dimensional array to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all the elements of the array to 0 to indicate that all seats are empty. As each seat is assigned, set the corresponding elements of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat is no longer available.

You program should never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the first-class section is full, your program should ask the person if it is acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice-versa). If yes, then make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves in 3 hours." 

For input, use a form input box and button. Validate input as 1 or 2. Simulate the printing of boarding passes and messages by using alerts.
